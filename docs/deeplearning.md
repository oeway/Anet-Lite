# Deep learning primer

Here we provide a quick overview what Deep Learning is, and establish the necessary
terminology to understand the tutorials

## What is deep learning



## Important terminology

* Different data-sets: training, test, validation
    - what are they for.
    - important considerations: no overlap between data-sets, how many per catergory, ...
* model
* input channel, target channel
* GPU, CPU. what it is? why and when do we need it?

## Train a neural network

* how to judge training progress
* how to see overfitting
* What are the parameters and how to set them:
    - `epochs`
    - `step per epoch`
    - `batch size`
* Using already trained models
  - directly
  - transfer learning
