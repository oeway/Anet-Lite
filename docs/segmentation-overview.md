#  Segmentation

Here we use A-net to perform cell segmentation with Deep Learning. We provide
workflows for a number of different segmentation tasks, others could be easily
added by using the provide Anet API.

1. Segmentation of **cell membrane**.
2. **TODO** Segmentation of **nuclei**.
3. **TODO** Segmentation of **cytoplasm and nuclei**.

In the section **workflow**, we describe each more detail and provide the
necessary installation links. In the other sections of this documentation,
we describe the different steps in more detail.

1. Manual annotation
2. Training
2. Prediction
4. Obtain segemented cells and nuclei
