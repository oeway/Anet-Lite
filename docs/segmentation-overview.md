#  Segmentation

Here we use A-net to perform cell segmentation with Deep Learning. We provide
workflows for the following segmentation tasks, other could be relatively easily
added by using the provide Anet API.

1. Segmentation of cell membrane.
2. Segmentation of nuclei.
3. Segmentation of cytoplasm and nuclei.

Below, we describe the scope of each workflow in more detail and provide the
necessary installation links. In the other sections of this documentation,
we describe in detail the different steps involved.

1. manual annotation
2. training
2. prediction
4. obtain segemented cells and nuclei

## Workflows
For each workflow, we provide an installation link for ImJoy to generate a dedicated
workspace with all necessary plugin, and the possibility to load a  pre-trained model.

This model can then be applied to test data to familiarize yourself with our approach.
The pre-trained model can also be used to initialize training on your own data.
This process (also called **transfer learning**) tends to reduce the time for training considerably,
